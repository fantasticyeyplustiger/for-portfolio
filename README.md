Sample of HTML and Javascript code I wrote for a website. Also contains some basic API

The code is essentially supposed to let the user type in both a song name and a Youtube link and check if its valid.
If it is, send the song name and Youtube video ID to the database.

User submits by clicking the submit button.
There's also a button that creates another input for any other additional links the song has.
